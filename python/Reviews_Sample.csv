5,Am very impressed,"This collar really works at great distances. After using the shock feature a couple times (reinforced with voice commands) all I need is the vibrate or beep audio tone to call my dog in. One day on a friends ranch, as I watched I let my Border Collie wander on her huge and many acre horse pasture. It was windy day and my dog was enjoying the attempt of rounding up a flock of birds. When the amusement was over for us both and time to bring her in I whistled and believed that because of the wind and the great distance, perhaps 400-500 yards, she didn't respond and believe she could not hear me. I 'paged' her with a simple beep and she picked her head up and saw me waving and came right back happily. It has been a good back up to voice commands and training tool and perhaps a life saver. I do not use it every day but only when the situation calls for it such as a walk in the woods which try I do often as I live in deep country. The collar and device are very well made and have taken a lot of abuse. I am a little more cautious with the remote I keep it on a leather rope/string so it is easy to get to hanging from my neck.",[],B01AL7D7JM,B01AL7D7JM,AFGAX6NGIQQ2SYMOKQRA2UVYKARA,2017-09-17 15:20:02.112,0,True
5,Lifesaver for Kitten,"I live waaaaay out in the boonies, and it isn't unusual for me to find abandoned baby animals. I keep these kits on hand for those just-in-case times when I can't get the animal to a vet for a day or two.  I last used this kit when I found a tiny, emaciated, nearly dead kitten. It was a Saturday evening, and I didn't want to bring my vet to her office for an emergency visit...I honestly didn't think the kitten was going to live. I used the Benebac tube and KMR (both included in the kit) right away, and the little guy made it until Monday morning. The vet recommended continuing KMR and Benebac powder (purchased separately - see note below) as directed until the kitten was strong enough for worming, vaccinations, etc.  Here's a warning about the bottle, however.  The method recommended on the package for creating a hole at the tip of the nipple is ineffective.  The nipple is too large for very young or small animals, so they have to lick the nipple rather than actually suck it.  Use small scissors to cut the top of the nipple off.  The liquid will not come out too quickly once the nipple has been twisted back onto the bottle.  You will have to squeeze gently, and be very patient.  As the instructions on the package warn, never hold an animal like a baby (on its back) when feeding it from a bottle.  Good luck!<br /><br />NOTE: See my review of BeneBac powder. It's invaluable for anyone with critters on long-term antibiotic therapy.",[],B0002ASS20,B0002ASS20,AHZUGOZIPYX34R2MZRSKERGHU23Q,2010-07-10 12:19:40.000,23,True

1,"... the appearance and initial quality of the product look great, there appears to be a lapse in the ...","Although the appearance and initial quality of the product look great, there appears to be a lapse in the design of this product.  We bought this as a cushion for a newer dog we just adopted and it was placed in the bottom of his cage.  Although we were told he was kennel trained, it appears he is not as he has done his business on this mattress about 4-5 times.  Each time I had to take the mattress out and put it through the washing machine (front loader).  I noticed after the first time of washing it that the cover was not rubber backed cover on the top area towards the pet but did appear to be rubber backed on the side facing the floor.  This means that if a pet pees on the top of the mattress it will soak through to the foam padding.  The foam padding has now disintegrated all the way to having a giant hole in the center of the foam pad after the 4th to 5th wash.  I only owned this for a couple months and now it is outside the return/ refund period.

4,"Absorbs waste well; noticeable, lightweight clumps; easy to remove from rest of un-used litter","There are some things I like and some things that I am not as fond of in regards to this product - Purina Tidy Cats Light Weight, Low Dust, Clumping Cat Litter, (Glade Clean Blossoms).<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />-- this litter clumps well, and is easy for me to remove, while leaving the rest of the litter in place.<br />-- pleasant aroma of Glade blossoms that helps make odor tolerable.<br />-- each time I took a cup's worth of litter from the box, and poured it into the litter pan, there was not too much dust kicking up, as compared to the cat litter I typically use.<br />-- lightweight litter means I only have to carry 17 lbs. instead of 35 lbs of similar litter.<br /><br />What I am not fond of:<br />-- the top of the box is difficult to open with my fingers. So, I used a bread knife to fully open the top of the box. This wouldn't stop me from buying more of the product. But, I would have liked for the box to have a perforation so that I can just tear it open more easily.<br />-- our cat tracked litter throughout the area. But, to be fair, this also happens with other similar cat litter we buy.<br /><br />What I am neutral about:<br />-- We've used this box for the past 16 days for our 1 cat. There's about 1/4 to 1/2 of the contents of the litter left. We typically buy the 40-lb or 42-lb litter packages, and in the same number of days, we usually go through about half the contents of those packages. And, the price we pay for those heavier boxes is less than the cost of this 17-lb package.<br /><br />Overall, I like this type of cat litter because it does what I want it to do: it absorbs cat waste well, easy for me to use a spatula to remove the noticeable clumps. I then add more litter to take its place. And, the odor while using this product is tolerable, in similar vein to our typical cat litter brand.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612aYuLYrGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612aYuLYrGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612aYuLYrGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DucC4I-vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DucC4I-vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DucC4I-vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PES-aDrtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PES-aDrtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PES-aDrtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fC4xUyRRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fC4xUyRRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fC4xUyRRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gBFQIWoRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gBFQIWoRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gBFQIWoRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jh7TR0w1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jh7TR0w1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jh7TR0w1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n3wmzp8+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n3wmzp8+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61n3wmzp8+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71awnvM6RtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71awnvM6RtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71awnvM6RtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71puU-v1ERL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71puU-v1ERL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71puU-v1ERL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qYJkJL5xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qYJkJL5xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qYJkJL5xL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07KYBW95S,B0CBP3WRT3,AE2O2C43KTYO4LXXGZWJZLE67GBQ,2019-09-14 13:00:22.655,0,False

It's also tricky to get his arms out of the jacket once it's on, so getting either in or out of it is taking some getting used to. Lastly, the leash loop hole could be a little bigger.

5,Great Cage!,"I love this cage!<br />For the price, this is an AMAZING product. The house is adorable, and the cage is actually very spacious for hamsters and mice- which is what it's intended to house. Currently, my four week old rats are living in it, and while it will eventually be too small for them, it's perfect for now. The pull-out tray makes cleaning the cage easier, and the cage can be taken apart and put back together with ease. It has two doors- one on top and one on the bottom. One of the only flaws is that the top door is very small, but like I said the cage is easy to take apart, so the whole roof can be detached if needed. It also has three levels, and plenty of places to hang hammocks and snuggle sacks. Really the only other flaw is that the bars of the cage aren't the most sturdy, and bend sort of easily, but they can be bent back just the same. My ratties don't use the wheel, but it's nice quality and doesn't make any noise! I also think all of the colors it comes in are just too cute.

5,Amazing litterbox IF maintained this way,"In the span of 2 years, I have tried 4 different litter boxes for my kitty. Apartment living is challenging for litterbox maintenance, especially with a kitty who digs so much. I read the reviews here and can see why some of the reviews were negative. However, I have found that HANDS DOWN, this is the best litter box for containing odor, reducing litter, trailing and dust, and is also aesthetically pleasing, stylish.<br /><br />Here is my secret for success:<br /><br />1. I use litter box liners, which I have shown in the picture. They fit inside this particular model and keep everything manageable. I scoop my box once every morning, then top off the litter with a little sprinkling a fresh litter.<br /><br />2. I use sweet scoop, natural litter and scoop and flush it directly into my toilet! I only flush one urine or bowel movement at a time, so I do not clog the toilet. It breaks up very easily and flushes. No stinky litter genie to manage, cheaper, and less plastic in the landfill!!<br /><br />3. I sweep the little teency bit of litter trail which is only right in front of the step after I scoop. Easy peasy.<br /><br />4. A huge pro for me is that there is a charcoal filter included in the dome of this litter box. It’s really awesome especially for apartment living where we don’t have the luxury of hiding the litter box in a basement!<br /><br />5. Once a week, I just pick up the entire litter liner bag and put it in the trash. The bottom of the litter box is spotless. no need to worry about the scooper missing spots due to the curved pan shape, as some have complained about. Some have also complained about urine leaking out the side or the top not staying on. I have had none of these problems and I am sure the plastic liner eliminates any risk of leakage.<br /><br />So products I use in a nutshell to keep litter area  obsessive-level clean:<br /><br />- this litter box<br />-Petmate jumbo litterbox liners<br />- Swheat Scoop flushable cat litter<br />- plastic or nonstick scooper<br />- Catguru scoop caddy<br />-small handheld brush and dustpan","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L-UntmTUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L-UntmTUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L-UntmTUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZhXcwyRfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZhXcwyRfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZhXcwyRfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mYEMWSs-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mYEMWSs-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mYEMWSs-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000256ESU,B0BJ33NWSV,AHR7HVLAB5S2TLFEFH34OS7W6MVQ,2022-09-28 01:09:13.012,112,True

4,Alright launcher with some design flaws.,"I haven't had mine long enough to confirm or deny that the bands wear out quickly. I did get a second set of tubes just in case. The launcher does work well though and it's fun to play with all the dogs at the park and be able to shoot different sizes of balls. I was going to get a tennis ball gun, but found this for less money and it's more versatile in that it can handle balls bigger or smaller than a standard tennis ball. The main con of this is the ball holder at the bottom of the handle.<br /><br />The product would honestly be better without that holder as when you pull the launcher back to fire a ball, it pulls the ball handle away from your wrist. When you release it, the holder snaps back and hits you on the bottom of the wrist and it's bare metal against bone most of the time. I've alleviated this by wrapping the holder in some felt tape to make a half inch cushion that hits the wrist instead, but it's still an annoying aspect of the launcher. I can't complain too hard, though, as I paid 8 bucks for this and 5 for an additional set of tubes. The guns I was looking at were 20+.",[],B00BIGLCI4,B079XCDLMB,AFYQCEOHAK6BXKHZFMBFMYOAUMSQ,2021-09-09 19:21:26.256,0,True

OK, anyways I use it on a tub, it leaks out the back and does balloon up if I have the pressure too high or I raise the outlet higher than the tub spout (science right there), so I have to manage the pressure and the height (have a smaller Dog so thats not a problem) It developed a pinhole, I called them they sent me a new one, happened twice. They where very nice about it. The last time it developed a pin hole I threw a washcloth over he spout and proceeded to keep using the same one for about a year (that's 15-20 baths). Today the hole got too big so finished washing the Dog the old fashioned way. Will order the replacement 3 pack right now knowing full well it will fail again because I am using it on a spout that its not intended to be used on. And they tell you that right in the description. Also if yours is falling off it comes with a large pink metal twist tie, thats to put around the outside of to to keep it from doing just that. do that to tight and it will develop holes also though. Why am I buy-in it again? Its the best way to wash my Dog I have found so far thats why.

It has been almost a month and has stood up to my little anxious hairball of terror. It's easy to set up if you take longer then 10 mins from open to done then you have issues lol.  My dog has started to settle down now that he realizes he can't escape now so he settles in while I am gone. Helping big time with my anxiety let alone his.

The ball has remained in the same location on the floor ever since (6 days now), so I will be sending back.<br />Obviously, since she won’t even try to play with it, I cannot provide any feedback on the actual durability or longevity or whether it is chew proof. HOWEVER, my dog chews on her large black Kong and is able to squeeze it flat. Given that I can easily depress this ball in many locations with just my thumbs, I have no doubt whatsoever that she would have destroyed this ball within a few hours.

I decided to pass on the antibiotic and then I started noticing waxy skin with hair loss and knew for sure that I was dealing with a fungal issue.

5,Awesome! Definitely buy the timer as well.,"This light is awesome. Absolutely amazing. I had another LED bar on my 55 gallon that I liked a lot. I was disappointed when it died recently, after only a year of use, but whatcha gonna do, right? I decided to try out this Beamswork after doing some research. Now I'm glad my old light died! This light is so much brighter, it's not even a comparison. Having the reds and greens mixed in with the white really makes for a much more natural light. The lunar setting is surprisingly bright but deep blue. I also purchased the timer, which works amazingly well. A little advice: When you don't use the timer, the &#34;regular&#34; setting uses all leds, ie whites, reds, greens, and blue (actinic). It makes for a beautiful and bright light that brings out a lot of color from your fish and decorations. The light, however is a little cool and not quite as natural. Whether that's what you prefer is a matter of taste. When you use the timer, you set the regular separately from the lunar. In other words, if you set the timer to turn off the lunar when the regular comes on, you will have the very natural light from reds, greens, and whites, without the blue actinic. Personally, I set them to overlap for a couple of hours morning and evening so that I have multiple phases through the day rather than just night and day. It sort of gives the feeling of morning, day, evening, and night. Oh, and my plants are doing great. Keep control of your water parameters, because with this much light you can get a lot of algae bloom if you let your water quality drop. Algae is generally considered unsightly, but it's very good for your aquarium. Personally, I allow the algae to cultivate on the back of the tank. I get the benefits of the algae, and because it's cultivated on the back, that's mostly where it grows. I don't get much algae growing on the side nor front because it already has a foothold on the back. Sort of like the concept of an algae scrubber. Some people love the way it looks. Others don't like it. I like it and it's my tank, lol, so this is the way I do it. Hope all this helps.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Yqa--DnbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Yqa--DnbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Yqa--DnbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F61VEIJDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F61VEIJDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81F61VEIJDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eEJUdW9fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eEJUdW9fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eEJUdW9fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01LFF07XS,B01LFF08QO,AF4CHENC654LALRHOA3SIDPZ25AA,2018-03-25 12:52:21.156,30,True

After that I noticed a dramatic change in his coughing after water consumption. It was so much less.. And last night he drank water and did not cough once. I will continue to use this product for George along with diet and exercise.. We live in Texas so it is blazing hot right now and getting out for walks is very hard.

He will walk long distances in very cold weather and through salted slush as well. They are kind of slippy on ice though as they don't have any strong tread on the bottom.

5,"Great for dogs, do NOT recommend for cats. Great product.","I would not use this product on cats of any age as they are very sensitive to it. It is a great product for dogs and it will kill the fleas.  The main thing is to have a container big enough to fit you pet into so they can be covered in the solution. On our farm we purchased this by the gallon and made up a 55 gallon drum of dip and put our working dogs in the barrel then poured the solution over the rest of their bodies.  For extremely long haired dogs as working collies, they hair needs to be soaked.  Use caution around the ears face and eyes as the fleas run there.  Have someone help you and begin pouring the solution around their as soon as they’re in the dip.  A 5 gallon bucket works great for smaller dogs. Used correctly this product will prove its self and the mix will keep for a couple weeks if you want to redip your dogs to further protect them from fleas and ticks.  Great product.

3,Does Not Remove Strong Feces Odors,"We are still testing this product to compare to Fresh Step Extreme litter.  My husband says the Extreme is the best on the market, but I dislike the Extreme because it produces a lot of dust. There is dust everywhere on the hooded litter boxes and around the floor. Also, it gets tracked everywhere and we have a huge mat under the boxes.  So I read a lot of review about litter and we absolutely had to have odor control in our five cat household.  Two cats poop odor would peel paint from the walls.  So far, I rate the Scented Formula Excellent for clumping and low dust.  In three days, I have not seen any dust on boxes or floor.  It also is not dusty when being added to the box, which is very important.  Cat urine odor control is great but poop order is zero minus zero for our little stinky cats.  After they finish up and leave the box, I will sprinkle Clear the Air Odor Eliminator over the area, which works immediately to counter act the smell.  Since we have three litter boxes, we plan to place the Extreme in 2 boxes and use 1 for the Worlds Best scented multiple cat because this box is closest to the bathroom toilet.  Now that I know the Worlds Best is flushable, I  will start discarding it down the toilet.",[],B009S64OI6,B08QF7GH3F,AGJ4TNHF45JQYMZ3S63TAXSXY2TA,2014-08-02 03:34:23.000,0,False
5,It works like a skimmer is supposed to!,"[[VIDEOID:436067b3358a05a667eed0e98067b1d9]] Although I can't speak about CAD Lights as a company, as I have never dealt with customer service and such, I feel I need to post a review that will really help people with this product and with skimmers in general.  I've been in this hobby for nearly 10 years and have even worked in the aquarium maintenance business a bit.<br /><br />Something that a lot of people new to the hobby don't understand is how protein skimmers work, or are suppose to work. I've seen every small protein skimmer under the sun and have tried a handful of them. This is hands down the best one I've used!  It actually works like a large skimmer you would find in a sump, but as a much smaller footprint.<br /><br />Those that have been complaining about the water just &#34;fizzing&#34; and never skimming or there being &#34;microbubbles in the tank&#34; need to understand that this is what is called the break-in period, and it is normal with ALL SKIMMERS - even the big expensive ones.  My PLS 50 Elite dumped a ton of bubbles into my tank for the first few days and sat there &#34;fizzing&#34; at the neck of the collection cup for nearly a week.  Low and behold, a week later it started creating skimmate and the micro bubbles went away.  Skimmers need to develop some &#34;slime&#34; in the chamber to<br />one: seal the cracks to prevent exiting bubbles and<br />two: give a surface that the foam can build and rise on.<br />Squeaky clean acrylic doesn't lend to this that well, which is why the water just sits there &#34;fizzing&#34; for a while. Not to mention any oils and such that may be on the unit from manufacturing need to be washed away first. (Running the skimmer in a 50/50 vinegar and hot water solution for a few hours  first can help speed this process up a bit as well.)<br /><br />Also, the skimmer is only going to work when you have broken down organics in your tank (AKA fish poop, uneaten food, etc...)  So if you put a skimmer in your tank a week after you start the tank, it's probably not going to start skimming right away! THE TANK IS TOO CLEAN!<br />Also, you want to set your &#34;fizzing&#34; foam at the base of the skimmer, below the collection cup, so the foam head can develop and rise into the neck of the cup providing more of a dry skim.  This way you don't keep filling your skimmer cup with clean water.<br /><br />I gave this skimmer 5 stars because for the price point, it's the best thing I've come across. It fits perfectly in my JBJ rimless 30 overflow (had to remove one of the media baskets), it runs very quiet, it has a real needle wheel skimmer pump mounted discreetly underneath the chamber, is easy to use, and performs like a &#34;REAL&#34; skimmer.  Adjusting the flow rate can be a little touchy, as others have mentioned, but it's not the end of the world. I also suggest playing with the height of the skimmer int he water for fine adjustments as well.  Once you get it dialed in, this thing is a true skimmer workhorse.  I obviously highly recommend this skimmer. :)  I'll make sure to post updates in months to come.",[],B00OWUQD3C,B00OWUQD3C,AECWAYUWVV2PDCHX3V4F4YSFZKHA,2016-08-23 15:47:35.000,1,True

2,"Works, but not the greatest. Won't purchase again.","I've had this leash in operation for almost a week. My two biggest complaints are that if you lock the leash (like let's say your dog is doing his business and you don't want the leash pulling extra tight on him/her to give the feel of more freedom), then you do simply push forward on the button to lock. THAT works great. But when you unlock it, it retracts so hard and fast it startles and jerks my dog's head a little bit. I have a 10-month Husky-Whippet mix (around 40 pounds). I like the ability to control the retraction as you do with some other leashes. Secondly, my girl LOVES to go on occasional ""rolling"" sprees. When she does these, I have noticed the tape gets so twisted and when it retracts (at Indy 500 speeds), it rolls up with the twists. I know this because the last 4 times we've been out, I've come back inside and taken out the leash the full 16' and it has twists in it and then reel it back in (semi-controlled) to fix it.

It was annoying and it really cut into our sleeping time. So we finally purchased this automated feeder and wow what a complete game-changer it was for us! Our cat has never woken us up again to be fed his breakfast.<br />The automated feeder just slides open and his breakfast is automatically &#34;served&#34; and it's been so wonderful.

It says to let it the shampoo sit (for 5-7 minutes?) after you lather it onto them, and that's what we did. We had to do it twice in a row, but after that he was completely flea-free. We also used a flea comb to be super sure we got all of them.<br /><br />The scent probably my biggest complaint - it's really strong. It's a citrus/orange scent. I felt really bad for my dog because I know citrus is one of the few scents he can't stand. Honestly if I'd realized that, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

5,The size is perfect for 10 pound cat,"I ordered the small size for my 10 lb cat. It is so much nicer than anything I could find in the pet stores. The size is perfect, I use the second tightest snap position. (The collar is available with snaps or Velcro, so make sure you order the right one).  The fabric is soft and cushioned around her neck...so much more comfortable than the plastic cone from the vet's office. She has stitches on her thigh and needs to wear the cone for 10 days. I take it off while she eats (wet food), and then give her some time to wash her face and groom herself while I sit close and watch her.  She is always ready to eat, so it's been easy to put the cone back on. I fasten the outer snap, then placing the cone on the floor with treats inside...when she sticks her face in to get the treats, I snap the inner snap. So far so good!

5,Good product considering it needs to meet differing requirements for different locations.,"We use this pet door to provide access for our dog (and our cats as well) from our home-office to an outdoor 10'x20' fenced pen.  The product is a good solution for an exterior wall installation, especially considering that it needs to meet differing wall thickness dimensional requirements for various installation locations.  We put one of these in our previous house, and it went 6 years with no problems or replacement parts needed.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty good, just have to be quite fussy about drilling the two thru-wall pilot holes exactly level and plumb so that the outside openings will align perfectly with the inside openings when done.  There is also little information given about how to deal with different types of siding at the exterior, as the outer door frame needs to seal flat and solidly around the perimeter to remain water-tight.  We have over-lapping wide-exposure cedar shakes, so I used the outside of the template to mark an outside line for the frame on the shakes, and over-cut the shakes slightly (and removed them) to allow for a small caulking joint between the frame (which installed hard against the flat wall sheathing) and the surrounding siding.<br /><br />The doors seems to be quite weather-tight, and the double magnetic flaps and weatherstripping appear to seal quite well.  There are still only two plastic flaps and some dead air between them, so insulation value is not super.  Keep in mind that this door (like most other pet doors) can also admit some of natures creatures into your house as well, so you may want to use the latchable plastic door panel overnight.",[],B077TQFTZ8,B0B6GNFPJD,AET4L7UQMR5Q7PCWWHGP3KUMPMFA,2021-01-04 00:38:06.846,2,True

5,My cat loves to love,"Tl;dr 10/10 buy these and follow directions.<br /><br />My smallest cat absolutely love to love on me. Unfortunately that means a lot of kneading behaviors on my skin with ten tiny sharp claws. One would think that after 4 years of life she would calm down with the needy cuddles but no. She has just gotten more cuddly with age. Literally my only complaint was how her claws hurt. When I rolled over at night it was play time, attacking my feet.<br /><br />Finally I decided to give claw caps a try for her. I had previously tried with my big boy, but over our 10 years together he has learned the safe places to knead. I didnt remember the claw cap experience fondly, so naturally I was leery of a cheap pack of caps. I remember years ago I paid about 20$ for a single pack of caps. Super concerned for a pack of 14 to be half that price!<br /><br />I will say these have not disappointed thus far. I counted them all out and separated the colors the day I got them and I really did get 13 unique colors out of the 14 sets I was given. I got two shiny clear with pink glitter sets (not a complaint from me!). Also included are 7 sets of glue, and 7 easy applicators for the glue.<br /><br />I tested one of the applicators with the first set i bought and decided it was easier to NOT use those. Either way her first set of caps lasted a week. I figured I got them on too soon to her shedding the nails to strengthen them. No problem. Just put her next set on tonight! Make sure to follow the directions and clip the nails first though. That will help keep them on longer.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is ny poor baby has to be burritoed in a blanket with one paw out at time for me to do this. But alas, we must all make sacrifices for the sweet sweet bliss of no midnight feet attacks and marred flesh for the kneading.<br /><br />10/10 I do enjoy these. They have made snuggle session so much comfier for me! No longer will i refuse the cuddle puddles from my baby girl! Even if each set only lasts me 1 week, I give 0 cares and I will consistantly be getting these for her.<br /><br />It has not changed her behavior in anyway, she is still as playful and loving as ever and I can not rest easy knowing she won't be able to destroy my poor flesh anymore!",[],B07JNMK9XH,B07JNK6Q6Z,AHM7WUGEPBRFNB5N37IJ2VMRYBMQ,2021-10-19 02:11:16.173,1,True

While I strive to feed my cats dry food that is grain-free, not every variety automatically appeals to or agrees with them.  Contrary to popular opinion, one size does not fit all when it comes to cat food.  They couldn't care less about nutritional value, only whether it tastes and smells good to them.  Bottom line, no matter how high the quality, it's a waste of effort if the cat won't eat it or it raises havoc with their digestive tract.  But I struck gold with this one and hope Purina doesn't change the current formula or flavor.  I gradually introduced it into my cats' familiar dry food a little at a time and finally swapped it out altogether.

Some people can wash and reuse these for longer lasting containers but to each their own. I just toss them and use the next.

To refill it I just use a cup and pour water into the top. This fountain comes with a charcoal filter and my cat Callista seems to really enjoy it. She loves batting at the free flowing  stream with her paw and drinking from it. It does make a water running type of noise as there is free flowing water but it's not to loud or disruptive. This fountain is very roomy and holds a good amount of water. Overall I'm very happy with this cat water fountain's quality and performance.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pa9Bep79L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pa9Bep79L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Pa9Bep79L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F5KRPF2,B07F5KRPF2,AFKCT7J6FX4O4ZQGXJC4G56KPYRQ,2020-06-01 09:43:46.017,48,True

5,Game changer for my aging pup,"My 14.5 hound mix has been showing signs of cognitive decline for a couple of years now. The longer it was going on, the more heightened her anxiety became, to the point that every move we made in the house had to be thought through so as not to freak her out and send her scurrying.<br /><br />My vet recommended Senilife (along w hemp of course), and I felt that I was seeing quite a positive difference! During covid, there was a 2 week period where I couldn't get replenishment. During the time that we were waiting for the new bottles to arrive, I was shocked at how much my pup regressed into her extremely-anxious tendencies, and you could see the confusion in her eyes. This more than anything showed me how much the Senile truly was helping give her such a better quality of life. My girl is around 45 lbs, and I originally gave her 3 capsules/day.

I wouldn't recommend for rough playing or destroying dogs though..",[],B005DGICDI,B0B2LYVJFD,AH2CPYYRT2IQS474FHVAUVRYBLJA,2013-02-28 16:49:05.000,0,False

So now it has a terrible hard water film on it that I cannot get off...I suspect it will never come off! Where I live now the water is perfect but the old hard water film catches all the slime and hair and it causes me to need to clean this more often, which is difficult because I disabled now and it is hard on me as it takes me a long time to take apart clean and put back together again.  However It does not have all of the intricate corners that are difficult to get to and that is a plus.<br />I have considered purchasing a new fountain but after reading all the nightmare reviews and since  my finances are pinched  I will stick with this one. I do wish that they would sell the premium filters packaged with the foam filters. I have been cutting a foam filter to size that is actually meant for aquariums.

5,My nails are nice again!,"I am so happy with this lotion, it really did wonders for my nails. They're awful and brittle and used to snap over tiny hits on shelves or something else pretty simple. You name it, it broke my nails. Using this lotion, I didn't have to worry. They would bend in a healthy way that didn't just snap them right off if I hit something.<br /><br />I tried other lotions that strengthened them, but ultimately they still snapped right off on impacts, which was so frustrating. They were stronger, but the part they would snap off was right at the edge near the skin, after growing them out for weeks.<br /><br />With this lotion, I've been able to grow my nails and have them last. They've only broken if I REALLY hit something too hard or at a bad angle, that type of thing. I would absolutely recommend *at least* trying this lotion!

1,Avoid,"I find this to be a horrible product.  My LFS rec'd I buy two of these when my Fluval Marine and Reef 2.0 LEDs went out.  I thought the setup for the Fluvals was bad but this is even worse.  First, one of the LEDs didn't work right out of the box.  I had to call AI customer support.  Instead of sending my out a new LED, they wanted to send me out the WiFi part that was broke and have me fix it myself.  Great, just what I want from a brand new product.  Took 1wk for the part to arrive, meanwhile my 75G tank only has one LED which is nowhere bright enough.  When the part arrived no instructions, again great.  After some doing figured out how to fix the broken one and got it working.  Now supposedly with two lights one should be the parent  and the other a slave.  Using the iOS program I can only get it to detect them both separately as parents which means they won't share the same settings. Now AI has decided to sell this product with minimal instructions in the box and nothing taking you through the setup.  Go to there website and there are no instructions you can download.  They have a few setup videos which are mostly useless. For the iOS setup the version of the app shown in the video is not the current one and doesn't have the same options so the video tells you nothing.  Given the reputation of AI I would have expected much more.  I can't believe I actually like the Fluvals better given how much problems they gave me.

5,Great Product with a Better Price,"I have a 75 gallon freshwater.  I was running a Fluval 406 by itself and I just did not have enough cleaning power.  I tried getting a used filter for about $80 and had nothing but issues with it.  I gave up and returned it.  I used the refund to buy a new Polar 525 gph.  I was hesitant because of the low price but do not regret it at all.<br />This filter is less than half the price I paid for the Fluval.  It has a much better flow rate and also has the UV sterilizer for algae control.  It primes faster than any filter I have ever owned.  My aquarium looks so much better now I have both running though it is a little overkill now.<br />Here is what I dont like.  The intake and outtake connections seem to be made for rimless tanks.  I had some issues connecting them securely around the plast rim.  I had to remove the little plate that screws securely to the edge and just depend on the screws to hold it.  It is secure, but I may look for alternatives in the future.<br />The spray bar is great but sometimes the pressure is just good enough for it to sound like a flute/recorder being played.

I have it on the progressive setting so if he keeps barking the shock will gradually get stronger. Before we leave we make sure he's gone potty and had exercise. He gets a stuffed kong and we leave the tv on for him. Every time we've come home he has been sleeping on his place. Nothing was destroyed, no potty accidents, just a quiet dog and empty kong.<br /><br />He hates the vacuum cleaner so I put this on him while I vacuumed to see how it works. He barked once and it didn't make any difference. When he went to do the second bark you could tell he felt the collar. He got the point after that.

5,Fantastic!,"When in the car, my big dogs are seat belted & sit on the floor of my van.  My new miniature poodle wouldn't be able to see anything if she was sitting on the floor so I ordered this carseat.  Right now, she's only about 10 weeks, so she has some growing to do, but I can see this is going to work great.  The breeder estimates her to grow to about 15-18 pounds.  The seat itself is well secured (doesn't move)  at the headrest & around the bucket seat.  I shortened the attached leash as short as it would go to prevent her from attempting to crawl out.  The removable liner looks easy to take out & wash, but I chose to use a towel for the time being as she's hardly been in the car & it would be faster if she gets carsick to change out the towel.  We only went on a short trip to the store.  Initially, she enjoyed looking out the window.  On the return trip, she decided to curl up & nap instead.

When we arrived home two hours later we began the process of unloading the car, bathing the kids and starting bedtime.  An hour or so after getting home my son looked at me with a slightly worried experession on his face and said &#34;uh-oh&#34;.  What is wrong my child, I innocently asked.  'I think I got them all, Mommy', was his sheepish reply.  My heart started racing.  'Got WHAT all, o love of my life,' I beatifically replied.  'The salamanders.

3,"Great cage, nightmare to clean","Pros<br />The size of this cage is awesome. It's huge & perfect for my two boys. I also love that it has two levels, both with actual floors rather than just small platforms you find with other cages.<br />It was relatively easy to put together. Having two people made it much easier. And it seems quite sturdy. Been using it a few months now & have zero issues with it's durability.<br /><br />Cons<br />Cleaning this cage really it awful, and I clean their cages daily so it kind of sucks. Because it's so big it's difficult reaching the back without actually crawling into the cage. The doors are large enough for a person on the small size of average to be able to do this, but it's not a ton of fun. The floors also have a grid-like texture, which makes scrubbing stray poops off a nightmare.<br />The opening to get to the top level is small & must be accessed via the included tube. It's fine for now but I see it being a problem as my ferrets age. The tube doesn't stay in place on it's own so my boys are Constantly moving it into positions that make it difficult for them to use. I didn't bother with the second tube.<br /><br />Overall though a decent cage.

4,Cats love it. It's filled with good crunchings and munchings.,"The AvoDerm Natural Grain Free Cat Food is a quality product that both of my cats are devouring as their always-available snack during the day and night.<br /><br />Let's start with the shape - these products are small and flat and round, which is the perfect size for crunching and munching. This is especially important for my &#34;senior&#34; cat who has sensitive teeth...he can really get into these and doesn't have to bolt them like a dog in order to enjoy them. The younger cat seems to take great delight is crunching them as loud as she possibly can...in the middle of the night.<br /><br />I haven't personally tasted the cat food in order to make a flavour assessment but if the behaviour of the cats is any indication, they LOVE the stuff. Sometimes they will poo-poo their noses at the moist cat food which should be a delicacy, and instead wander back to the bowls of the crunchy cat food. I take this to be a positive sign that they really dig it.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed with the senior cat, is that his breath actually improves after having some of this food. His regular breath is pretty ridiculous since he's older and doesn't always do a good job cleaning his mouth after a meal. But after a few crunches and munches of this dry cat food, his breath is significantly improved. It seems to help clean off some of the buildup in his mouth - and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with the product and will be ordering it again as soon as we run out. The cats love it, and I love that the cats love it. And you'll love that I love that the cats love it if you love this review.<br /><br />Love.",[],B00KS81B5M,B07Y46F189,AEJ2QJOLI6XFQCC3QLHEYYK2BIRA,2015-04-01 01:49:55.000,2,False

5,AWESOME leash!,"I love riding my bike and I love my dog, so this thing has been great for both of us.  I've had this for about 7 months and my dog LOVES it.  He's a 50 lb. dog and it fits him perfectly.  It attaches very easily to the bike, and the bar snaps on and off with no effort.  The first time I hooked my dog up to it he was hesitant for about 10 seconds but then he got the idea very quickly.  Now he happily freaks out whenever I pull it out of the drawer to take him on a run.<br /><br />I took the advice of one of the reviewers below and bought a $10 harness that is far better than just attaching it to his collar, because with the harness the leash attaches above his shoulders and doesn't choke him at all.  Highly recommend doing this than putting it on a collar.<br /><br />The great thing about this leash is that my dog can run at full speed for minutes on end.  He gets a great amount of exercise and there is no constant pulling on the leash like when I had to walk him.  I can't imagine not having this now.  The rope did fray after about 6 months because of the constant pulling (I use it almost daily), but it is easily replaceable.  You can buy about 100 feet of thin rope at the hardware store for less than $10.  You only need about 2-3 feet to replace it.  Easy to just unscrew the top of the bar, remove the springs and replace the rope.  Take note of how it is knotted at the bottom and connected to the hook.<br /><br />Couple things to take note:  my dog does like to dart after animals (we have a LOT of deer where we live), so you need to be on guard if your dog does the same thing.  He will run to the side and it will pull the bike to the right, but he hasn't come close to yanking me down, just made me a little off-balance.  Also, he will tend to stop suddenly if he wants a break or has to go potty.  Usually we're not going too fast when he does this but it is something to take heed of.<br /><br />All in all this thing is great and gives my dog way more exercise and fun than a standard walk.

5,Happy customer!,"We didn’t purchase this collar set from Amazon, but from a private person. He was selling it on Facebook Marketplace and we then found out he is a local online dealer. We got a great deal on it as he said it was returned because the person who purchased it used it once simply returned it. He offered to test it for us (the kit includes a tester), which he did. We’ve had it for a week and are VERY happy with it!!<br /><br />We were originally wanting a two collar set but when we came across the single collar, we couldn’t pass it up as we had just gotten a 6 month old puppy (Great Dane) who is very stubborn and needed one ASAP!<br /><br />You can use the remote for two separate collars and after using it for a few day we contacted the seller again asking if we could purchase a second collar. He offered us a new or used and we just purchased the used collar. If it works as well as the one we already have.. we’ll be very happy buyers!<br /><br />The second collar will be for our 2 year old Rottweiler. I don’t think we’ll have to use it much, as he’s a pretty good boy, but now that he has a brother to get into mischief with.. we wanted to have it just incase. He also has stated challenging me (mom) sometimes when dad isn’t home and I give him a command- which isn’t going to fly.<br /><br />So far for our Great Dane, we’ve only used to longer prongs and the vibration setting on about 40. He does NOT like the vibration at all and quickly corrects his behavior. We of course tell him “no”, “come”, or whatever command before using the collar but he’s very stubborn. After just a few days of using the collar his behavior already started improving. We’ve only used the shock setting twice on 20 when he tried to chew up the collar and dads weight bench outside.<br /><br />Overall we’re very happy! It’s the affordable, effective collar we were looking for.",[],B01K1AFJAE,B01K1AFJAE,AEEPZ4ACJSOWNVLKAACHRB4PAS3A,2018-05-29 20:45:23.294,0,False
4,Scared cat approved!,"I have a little 10lb cat and this carrier is great for her.  I took her on a Jet Blue flight and although the dimensions of this carrier were a little larger than what was posted on the website, they did not give me any trouble.  It was a little tight under the seat but b/c it's soft sided I was able to squish it in a little.  As expected, my kitty was not a happy traveler and the flight scared the crap out of her.  She meowed like crazy and fought like hell to try to get out but Mr. Peanut's carrier kept her safely inside so she didn't run loose on a Jet Blue plane.  I felt terrible for her but she survived the trip just fine!  The mesh windows all around were nice so your pet can see out all angles.  I can't imagine a cat much larger than 10lbs being comfortable though.  My only complaint is the bed inside is dry clean only.  During one car ride, she did have an accident.  I threw it in the washing machine, not realizing it was dry clean only.  Now the foam inside is all bunched up on one end, not really sure what to do about that...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31enzuGaxKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31enzuGaxKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31enzuGaxKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pftDb+3fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pftDb+3fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31pftDb+3fL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41af3aGm+6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41af3aGm+6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41af3aGm+6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01ERR6NAW,B01ERR6NBG,AHAX4OKIBRUZTNKA6LFFGUWJGZYA,2017-03-03 19:00:22.000,26,True

This Slo-Bowl was featured at a dog show web site and we found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately.  The first time we used it we distributed ALL his meal in the bowl, where it fell into the spiral groove and made him really spend a lot of time and effort to tongue the food up to eat.

5,WOW impressed,"Since I have 3 dogs, I feel like I've tried a lot of different products for pet hair removal. So I have to say that I did not go into this experiment with very high hopes, but I more like, well it's only $8 so if doesn't work, and it's got to be better than lifting the vacuum up on the couch, which is the only thing that currently (only marginally) works, and since it's a pain, I rarely do it, and that's why I have a pet hair problem.<br /><br />To be fair, I have a couch fabric (purchased before my latest dog, whose hair sticks to everything) that is not recommended for pet hair, as it's a woven fabric and the hair literally weaves itself into the fabric. The contrast between hair color and couch color are also not optimal.<br /><br />So it arrived and even my daughter (who never cleans anything voluntarily) was having fun cleaning the couch and did a small area. When I had more time, I did the whole couch and got a HUGE pile of hair. I'll tell you, it's also a bit of an arm workout, in a good way. When my daughter came downstairs after I was finished, she commented twice how clean the couch looked, hence the impressed title of the review. A couple of days later, I did the couch again, not as much of an arm workout this time, but much less hair.<br /><br />I will heartily recommended this product. The only improvement I would suggest would be a hole in the handle so it can hang with your cleaning products. I fashioned a hanger from some hair elastics and hung it by the couch so I can use it when I'm watching tv.

I tightened up the magnets (clearance)per instructions and my door doesnt blow open.  Its in a breezeway between the garage and house.  Door is tall and skinny.  My female Lab is 24 inches tall (withers) and 9 inches wide so this door was perfect for her build.<br />  Only downside is no interior trim.

Works great.<br /><br />UPDATE 3 YEARS LATER......2-07-15....Door is just fine.  After a couple of years the door hinge loosened up and the door droop'd a little and that hurt the fitment and the noise it makes.

The dog pulls some on the walk as she gets excited and the device worked well to keep her from running off. However, after 3 months of using it an average of 2 days a week it finally broke at one of the yellow clips. The dog got loose and ran around the corner to try and play with someone's dog that was out on a walk. That person freaked and was rather upset as they thought our dog would ""eat"" their small dog. While irrational, it still made the situation awkward and we wished it hadn't broken. Unfortunately it's past the Amazon return window (real convenient time to break), but will try and return to seller.<br /><br />Lowered by 1 start on 10/16/14 after two ignored emails from their customer service. Finally a response stating that because I bought it through Amazon they would not stand by their product's defect and issue an RMA.

5,"A miracle in a box- awesome, and humane is the PetSafe Gentle Leader Deluxe Headcollar!!!","I love my size medium PetSafe Gentle Leader Deluxe Headcollar, in the red Rolling Bones design. It's perfect for my service animal Alleigh. She weighs 79 lbs. and is 1/2 Aussie Shepherd, 1/2 Great Pyrenees so she has a medium sized, long snout. The gentle leader is a better alternative to walk your dog safely with. It is more humane for your dog to wear than a standard dog collar other than the hanging of the pet's I.D., license, and rabies tags from because a dog can SERIOUSLY injure their neck if they suddenly bolt, jerk or pull on the leash if they happen to see another dog, cat or animal and get excited or want to chase, fight etc., that other animal. Your pet also might get scared in some circumstances and try to shy/run away from a noise, car, if they are scared/attacked of/by another animal, or any other disturbance quickly pulling/jerking on the leash causing themselves injury as well. Not to mention sometimes tangling themselves in the lead in in the dog's excitement or skirmish- which unfortunately can trip or injure you too if the dog is out of control!!! That brings me to the most wonderful aspect of what the PetSafe Gentle Leader Deluxe Headcollar does for your dog! It allows for your dog to safely stay in control from literally the very first time your dog wears it- if you work with your dog and follow the directions provided and watch the DVD. It really is a ""miracle in a box"" as I call it, for dogs who are rambunctious leash walkers or have obedience issues while on a leash. I first should mention: it by no means is a ""muzzle"" and be forewarned some folks may question you as to ""why is your dog wearing a muzzle"", for the gentle leader fits over and is worn by your dog on it's nose and around it's head/neck and looks similar to a standard dog muzzling device. I am asked this question ALL the time. It's rather annoying, and some people even want to know if my dog is ill tempered. She is the furthest thing from that, but being a working service animal, and highly trained she must be in 100% control @ all times with her mind focused on her ""job"". You will most likely have to explain to some people why your own he/she is NOT wearing a muzzle but a gentle leader and educate them as to why it is the BEST thing your dog could be wearing or ANY dog for that matter and that regular collar users could potentially inflict pain or cause harm.injury to their dogs. The gentle lead keeps your dog safely and humanely in control by allowing you to lead your dog by the leash being attached to the side of the lead coming off of the dog's nose and NOT the dog's neck. The dog's nose is HIGHLY sensitive containing all of it's olfactory senses and a dog leads themselves around with their noses. They will generally protect their noses. Attaching the gentle lead to the dog's nose guarantees that a dog will stay in control because they will not jerk with the lead on their nose, it will not be comfortable for them if they do that, BUT it will not cause them any pain, and YOU will be leading them around safely without having to worry about the dog injuring their neck if the dog should see another animal, want to fight or chase them etc. I can guarantee with the first use AND your dog will be transformed into a well behaved dog on a leash. The gentle lead controls your dog by controlling your dog's senses humanely. He/she will not pull, drag or tug you anymore on a leash!!! I give the PetSafe Gentle Leader Deluxe Headcollar, size Medium, red Rolling Bones design, that came with a matching leash & instructional DVD (this is my second gentle leader I have had another for over 2 years- they are VERY durable) 5 out of 5 stars- I recommend everyone who wants a well behaved dog and a nice time walking them to buy the set today, it's worth every penny and your dog will be happy, healthy and 100% leash obedient from the very first use if you follow the directions provided and work with your dog.<br /><br />*** WATCH THE DVD FIRST & FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS PROVIDED! This is not a ""just put it on your dog and away you go"" product in some/most cases.

5,Great quality and my puppy loves it!,"[[VIDEOID:cf2ac40137d4a87baa7f67569a51629]] Puppies love to forage around for their food, and this snuffle mat helps satisfy their urge. My 4 month old puppy loves it! It keeps him occupied, as he has to use his sense of smell to uncover the kibble. The quality of the snuffle mat is great. I thought my puppy might try to tear at the cloth, but he stays focused on just getting the kibble that I hide through the folds.

They help minimize the litter mess.<br /><br />The bad things about this particular order. It came with tape all over the litter box, which left sticky residue all over the top and side of the litter box. Which, I think goes without saying, isn’t preferable when cats and litter are involved. Secondly, it didn’t come with the scoop. Not a huge deal for me since I have scoops (and the scoops that come with these are rather small which I know due to ordering the same box from Target) but it specifically states that a scoop is included in the listing and on the label. So, it’s annoying paying for something and not receiving everything.<br />All in all, I’d suggest ordering from Target vs from this seller.

4,"Not the cat amusement park I was hoping for, but they do use it.","Needed something for our kitten, because she was young & rambunctious, jumping all over our stuff, and causing havoc in the apartment. We have 2 cats, but only one of them play with it, but I think that's just the territorial nature of cats, not so much that the other one didn't like it. My cat is relatively small, and even she doesn't fit well in the 2nd & 3rd tier cubbies if you wanna call them that. Honestly, she mostly jumps to the top & lays on the highest pedestals. She'll often use those top round discs to jump onto higher bookshelves, because apparently my cat think she rules over all of us.<br /><br />As for build quality, the cat tree tower stands up pretty well even to the vicious clawings of my cat. I really do like that she has something of her own that she can jump all over & scratch her claws on. If it weren't for that, I'm pretty sure my furniture would be her next best option. The instructions could've been better, but hey, it's not a model rocket, just a cat tower. All the pieces were there, and labeled well, so it made assembly fairly easy straight forward. The only thing I had difficulty with was the little ladder part at the bottom. I kinda had to bend the metal brackets a bit to get the angle of the ladder to sit right. Everything has to kinda line up well for the overall sturdiness to be sound. Besides that, everything else fit together pretty seamlessly. It's pretty sturdy on its own to be honest, even though there's a little loop on the side that you can use to secure the whole cat tree to the wall, or another piece of furniture. If you have a bigger cat, you might want to really consider using that, because they could possibly knock the whole thing over, jumping off the top discs onto something else.<br /><br />For $60, I'm pretty happy with our purchase. I wouldn't expect your cat to play with it so much, but I'm pretty certain most cats would enjoy having something of their own that they can at least climb to the top of, and use to jump around. That seems to be what our cat enjoys doing the most. Carpet upholstery is actually better quality than I thought it would be. A bigger cat with longer claws could probably shred up some parts given enough time, but hey, I'd rather they scratch the hell out of this than our expensive furniture. For $60, this is definitely a solid buy. I really want to put some floating shelves up on the wall a little bit higher than the top of the cat tree, so she has something to jump onto, I think that would make this much more enjoyable for any cat. Would've given it 5 stars if the build quality was a little better. This is like the low-end IKEA version of a cat tree. Will definitely work, and not fall apart, or get torn up right away, but everything has a shelf life. There's definitely better quality cat trees out there if you wanna spend around the $100+ range. If your cat loves to jump around & do laps around your place at 2am, then they'll probably enjoy this cat tree.",[],B0794T79KM,B074DQQM8D,AHHJBTYBU7OFXQNYHGKMGL6XNUTQ,2020-08-03 22:39:04.332,0,True

3,Convenient way to feed my large dog! (Until it wasn't),"Whelp....it's been almost 8 months and I think it's dead. New batteries and reprogramming don't seem to help. It beeps and nothing works. Bummer. Reducing to 3 stars..but maybe I should go to 2.<br /><br />Edit: 5 weeks later - There's no indication that the battery is low, but the clock lost 11 minutes. Easily reset it and we're back on track. No other complaints! I maintain 4 stars because it's not perfect, but it works as intended. I fill the hopper about once a week.<br /><br />Edit 2: Duracell batteries lasted just under 4 months.<br /><br />Original review:<br />We've been using this for one week so far to feed my labrador retriever and it seems to be working well. By day 2, I found him sitting in front of the machine just before meal time, waiting for his food. He eats 1.5 cups of food twice per day. I've measured twice and it's a little over, but pretty close. The first time we used it, the loud noise scared my large dog, but once he discovered that it dispensed his food, he had no issues with the sound. It's now sitting on a folded towel on the tile floor and not nearly as loud. Although a feisty dog could probably remove the lid to get inside, it's pretty tight and neither of my dogs has made any attempt. Regarding the programming - the instructions were quite straightforward and I had no problem. It's not intuitive, but that's why they provide instructions. You do have to program it to dispense on the hour (there's no half hour option). I'm not using the recorded voice feature.<br /><br />Pros:<br />So convenient!<br />My dog won't be overweight.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It takes about 5 minutes to run enough cycles (1/4 cup at a time) to feed my dog. He eats the quarter cup and waits for it to spit out more.<br />It might look like there's food in there, but if it's not above the shoot, it won't dispense.<br /><br />Notes: We're feeding Purina One Smart Blend Lamb & Rice.

5,This ball continues to survive my 75 pound Husky!,"If you have a highly active and/or aggressive chewer, and like us tend to have the hardest time finding a toy that can withstand your dog's wild ways for longer than 5 minutes, then this is the ball for you!<br />We have a mutant Husky (we rescued him from a shelter so age and origins are unknown; all we really know is that he is larger than any Husky most have ever laid eyes on- people/vets who lay eyes on him have been overheard referring him with exclamations such as ""Wow, he runs like a horse!"" ""Mommy can we ride him?"" and the like...) who loves to chew and destroy the bejesus out of every toy we give him. In our house, most toys last 2-3 minutes before being rendered useless, with lifespans of the ""high-performing"" ""indestructible"" toys typically averaging about 5-6 minutes. That is, until my fiancé ordered one of these bad boys. That was almost exactly 2 months ago, and believe it or not this ball is still kicking!<br />The best part about this ball is that just when you think it's donezo, it literally somehow re-inflates itself and is good as new! I've never seen anything like it! About a week ago, while our mammoth-sized Husky was chomping away on his beloved Chuckit ball, we heard the dreaded sound that signals that a toy's end is near- the inevitable *POP* indicating that ""another one bites the dust"". We assumed his ball was done for and, like any average unhinged obsessive doggy parents, immediately ordered 3 more with rushed next-day shipping (the dude does love the thing, and it already has lasted longer than ANYTHING else we've tried). However, 5 minutes later he was tossing it around again, and it looked good as new! I am not exaggerating- his original ball is still kicking despite a large and visible gash in the side of it! Even the dog seemed surprised by the ball's continued existence. Our whole family loves this ball so much that we of course did not cancel the 3 more we ordered, so currently there are 4 Chuckits of varying sizes being tossed in, around, and outside of our house at any given moment, and we could not be any happier.

Our guess was not just based on her coat and other physicalities, but also her personality and habits (I forget what those traits are called for dogs but anyway she “acts” like her breeds with extremely strong herding instincts and love of livestock!)<br /><br />I think people unhappy with their results either are guessing solely based on what their dog looks like, or got duped by a shady breeder! If your breeder “guaranteed” certain breeds but you took a test anyway, you must’ve had some doubts…<br /><br />Anyway, it’s the extreme accuracy that has me so broken hearted that I *could’ve* known what our beloved geriatric lap dog was, but emBark screwed up her test. We sent off the swabs for both dogs, waited patiently, got the results back for our cow dog, then continued to wait for the results of our lap dog. Our geriatric lap dog ended up dying.

1,RIDICULOUS,"I BOUGHT A BARK COLLAR 7 YEARS AGO FROM THIS COMPANY WHEN MY BABY WAS A PUPPY.  IT WAS AND IS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD SO I IGNORED THE BAD REVIEWS.

HE HATED IT SO MUCH, AFTER THAT, I ONLY HAD TO HOLD IT UP FOR HIM TO SEE AND HE TOOK OFF FOR THE NEAREST SAFE HAVEN; UNDER A TABLE, BED, WHATNOT.<br /><br />HERE'S WHY IT'S STILL WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD.  I HAVE A LITTLE 19 LB PEKAPOO (PEKINGESE AND POODLE).  ANYONE WHO OWNS A SMALL DOG KNOWS (OR SHOULD) THAT IF THEY GET HOLD OF A BONE IT'S A DISASTER.  1 - YOU AREN'T GOING TO GET IT AWAY FROM THEM WITHOUT HURTING THEM IN SOME WAY (DON'T HAVE THE HEART FOR THAT) AND 2- IF YOU DON'T GET IT AWAY FROM THEM THERE'S  A DEFINITE CHANCE IT COULD KILL THEM.<br /><br />MY LITTLE GUY GOT A NASTY RAGGED BONE THAT WAS FORTUNATELY LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO GRAB ONE END OF IT.  I YELLED, I SWEET TALKED, I PRETENDED TO CRY.  NO LUCK.  SO I THOUGHT, OK, I'LL KEEP HOLD OF THE BONE WITH ONE HAND AND PICK HIM UP, CARRY HIM HOME AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

2,There must be something better than a Thundershirt,"I think these shirts are probably best when used on short-haired dogs.  The industrial strength Velcro is a real pain to secure when the dog has long hair and the hair gets caught in the Velcro.  It would be helpful if the Thundershirt could be fitted once upon the dog, and never have to be re-sized/re-fitted/majorly adjusted each time the Thundershirt is used.

I had tried the clove-peppermint wipes (after I found out all the cats objected strongly to the smell, I figured somebody should use them) but they dried out my skin. This didn't. It was at least as effective as bug repellent made for humans, and I wasn't worried to use around the kittens.<br /><br />Comfortis was what finally got rid of the fleas.

4,Keeps my cat from scratching the door,"Lifesaver! My cat does not like to sleep through the night; rather, she likes to wake me up and then ignore me when I'm awake (what a brat). I started locking her outside of my bedroom at night, but she'd start scratching at the door at 4am until I came out, and then she'd promptly ignore me! In attempts to get sleep, I tried ignoring her (the scratching became more vigorous), yelling at her (the scratching became more vigorous), spraying her with water (the scratching became more vigorous), and just letting her in the room (she'd lick my face until I woke up). Clearly, the lesson learned is that my cat enjoys making me feel miserable. This SSScat changed that. I set it up in front of my closed door, and the first night I heard her come to the door to scratch, a &#34;SSSS&#34; sound, and a high-pitched &#34;MRAWWWW&#34; and jump. Since then, there has been no scratching of the door. I don't even think I would need to turn the thing on; my cat is horrified of the device when she sees me take it out, and when she sees it she stays a foot away and never takes her eyes off of it.

4,"My dogs like everything, including cat toys","As someone who is owned by cats, I am constantly looking for toys to entertain and amuse my furry kids.  My dogs like everything, including cat toys, but the cats are harder to shop for.  They usually prefer the box.  I liked this cat toy.<br /><br />The box includes one small light up ball, and six easy to snap together pieces.  The ball was lit for about a week, and then stopped lighting. There is no on/off switch on the ball, if there was it probably would affect it's ability to roll smoothly.  There are 4 curved pieces of track so that you can make a circle, and two small end pieces so that you could opt to make a wavy line instead. There are openings on the top portion of the pieces so that a cat can bat at the ball while it moves along the track.<br /><br />If I give the ball a tap in the track it spins around in a circle 2 or 3 times.  One of my cats is mildly entertained for a minute or two by this toy, but he really enjoys literally sitting in the middle of the circle it forms.  He seems to think it makes a good throne for him.  When I formed it into a wavy line it did not appeal to him at all.<br /><br />As for the box, my cats could probably curl up in one at a time it if it were a top opening box, but this is a side opening box.

I was worried by some of the reviews that said their cats did not enjoy the flavor, but I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Great news! My kittens love the taste.

The solution I found was to keep the waterer pretty full to prevent the top section from overheating.  (Basically the element has no place to send the heat if the water does not touch it, overheats, and seperates from the bottle.)

1,Something Changed-Now Dry & Smelly!,Have been using this product since adopting our guinea pig Aug. 2022.  Was very happy up until latest purchase.  Opened up the bedding bag despite the odd plastic/chemical smell.  Figured it was just due to shipping.  WRONG...the bedding itself smelled this bad!

5,Quality high density foam dog beds,"So there are a few very important things you need to know when buying this product. First as you can see in the photos I posted that the measurements are a bit less than advertised. I let the beds sit out (I bought one for each of my Belgian Malinois) for 3 days to allow them to properly expand since they come vacuum sealed. So I think the company should adjust the measurements listed. Now there is another and extremely IMPORTANT reason why I let these dog beds sit outside (with all the covers off) for 3 days. The chemical smell from the fire retardant to meet shipping codes  is so awful and strong. The package says to let air out for 6 to 10 hours before use. This recommendation needs to be changed! Remember a canine's sense of smell is stronger than ours and it took 72 hours of these sitting outside for me to nolonger smell that chemical smell. Foam bedding for humans or pets, is only safe to use when oder is no longer present. So be a good dog owner and don't put your dog on this bed while its still stinky! Also wash the covers before you let your dog lay on it because the covers have the same smell. After all that, these make incredible dog beds! They are huge which I love and they appear to be a high density foam because neither I or my dogs sink when laying on it. My dogs definitely love these beds more than any other and lay on them and wrestle on them all the time. Its nice that they have a comfortable place on the wood floors. I shopped around for a while before I picked them because my dogs deserve the best. I think the cost is reasonable since these dog beds will actually last for years. I covered the beds in an additional sheet for cuteness, extra protection, and ease of weekly laundering.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916EUBSLrLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916EUBSLrLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916EUBSLrLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MGX8TJ0rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MGX8TJ0rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MGX8TJ0rL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1eN8PljYTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1eN8PljYTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1eN8PljYTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YS-IUJqMS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YS-IUJqMS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YS-IUJqMS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1oVrfRiBrS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1oVrfRiBrS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1oVrfRiBrS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0757MKHP1,B0BR4SYWQG,AGAI7XT4RVSGB6TPVN456GBFRCSA,2021-01-21 15:06:25.042,22,True

And he chewed some on the footing, as he was figuring out how to hold it properly to get maximum leverage to extract the paste.

I have three Armarkat trees that are 7 years old and are doing just fine despite multi-cat use (abuse, lol). I just got two of this tree, they each took maybe 10 minutes to put together and they are awesome. The only thing they don't come with is something to cover the bolt heads on the bottom to protect your wooden floor. I used the thin felt for the bottoms of chairs and table legs, simple. I greatly prefer the fleece covering to a carpet covering for a couple of reasons: their claws cannot get stuck in the felt, it is simple to brush hair off of it and if a hairball gets upchucked on it it is extremely simple to clean. Armarkat creates very cat-friendly designs too, other companies will make trees that require the cat to climb straight up and then have to jump all the way down from the top even if it's a 6 ft. tree. That's dangerous for the cat. Armarkat trees always give the cat a safe way up and down so he can have fun without falling 6 feet to the floor.

5,JERRY-RIGGED IT TO WORK WITHOUT VELCRO OR SCREWS . . .,". . . at least during the winter when I have no intention of opening that window.  (Have no idea what I'm going to do once summer comes around.  Perhaps I'll leave that window closed & open one of the other windows in that room instead).  Have not figured out how to load a photo of what I did, so here it is in written form.  Hope you can understand what I'm saying:<br /><br />On each of the two legs - I secured one end of a flat shoe lace to top-most section of leg closest to wall, with a ping-pong size wiffle ball tied to the other end of the shoe lace.  Held cat bed against wall, draped shoe laces across window sill, and securly closed & locked window - leaving wiffle ball on outside of window.<br /><br />Only reason for the wiffle balls was to keep the shoe laces from sliding out from under the closed window should weight of cat eventually cause it to slowly slide out.  My cat weighs only 9.5 pounds, so that has not yet been a problem.  (has been in place for over 2 months now).  What took me the longest, though, was coming up with the proper length of shoe lace/wiffle ball placement so when window is closed, the wiffle ball is snug against the outside of the window (to avoid slippage).<br /><br />One other thing I did different was (after reading this on someone else's post) I reversed the position of the bolster so instead of the bolster being against the window as in the photo, the bolster is on the side of the bed away from the window since the cat is usually looking out the window & not into the room.<br /><br />Overall, the product is very well made - very nice looking and sturdy.  (I did have to use a hammer, though, to secure the legs (after covering that section of leg with a folded towel to prevent damage from the hammer.)  Oh yeah, and the cat loves it once she figured out how to get up on it.",[],B000795XMY,B000795XMY,AF7JFSDNXRTOK5FRI5JXJHLFTQRA,2013-01-21 01:32:10.000,0,True

2,"Buyers BEWARE, Read Description On Bottle Upon Arrival, Not Just Product Package!","I have ordered this numerous times from Chewy.com, Petco.com, and purchased in store in both petco and Petsmart, as well as from Amazon.com and never had any problems until my last 2-3 purchases of it here on Amazon.

To my surprise though, the regular Cat Calming Diffuser Refills were shipped to me in the product packaging for the MULTICAT Diffuser Refills, rather than the Multicat refills (if that makes sense). This has now happened the last 2 or 3 orders I placed for the Multicat Diffuser refills, and I didn't bother wasting my time to return them because I was completely out of the refills when my orders arrived, and my 3 cats get very aggressive with one another if I don't have some type of the phenermone diffusers plugged in throughout my home (even after living together under the same roof the last 9-10 years :-( So I kept the orders although the wrong type of diffuser refill was inserted in the product packaging of the kind I actually needed and ordered, to try & keep the peace in my household between my 3 fur babies. But there is definitely a difference between the regular diffuser refill and the Multicat refills that my cats are use to having plugged in throughout my home, and they definitely need the multicat. I went to my local Petco and bought 6 spare of the multicat refills so that if I do decide to give it one more chance ordering from Amazon and it arrives with the wrong product in the product package again then I won't be up a creek without a paddle like i was the last few times with a household of angry kitties.....",[],B0002DHR1K,B095KSCSQV,AFUMJROJOD77FYSNZHOOG46PWI4Q,2021-04-07 09:39:34.395,3,True

5,Saved my dog's irritated skin,"I have a 5lb Papillon who started to suffer from some pretty acute dermatitis this Fall. Not sure if this was an allergic reaction to something in the grass, but she began aggressively itching her skin. I could see scabs and sores all around her ears and head, a few on the chest. I was beginning to get worried. I had tried neosporin like my vet had recommended which turned out to be the worst idea ever because it took forever to get the goo out of her hair. After trying to rinse out the neosporin, her skin was very inflamed and red and there were a lot more scabs and sores. I desperately searched on web for a cure before taking her for an emergency vet visit. I came upon this and figured I'd give it a try. WOW this is amazing.<br /><br />Within 1 day of using this, I already noticed that her skin was much less red and irritated and she was beggining to stop itching. After one week, her scabs were healing and she had much fewer than before and had completely stopped itching. After two weeks, her dermatitis had completely subsided and she had no scabs, no inflammation, no itching no issues.<br /><br />It's been about a month now, and she has had NO reoccurrence. Her skin is completely soothed and healthy and her coat is growing out beautifully. Thank you so much for saving us a trip to the vet and helping to restore my dog's inflamed skin. 10/10 would recommend.",[],B0002I9O98,B092D84K2V,AHHUKBFG5I3TLFU2VQ6KT6GKE5RQ,2020-10-22 13:17:12.925,2,True

5,Impressed - better than expected,"We were skeptical when we decided to purchase this, we currently use an Andis 60105 and had it for years, we wanted to get a quieter trimmer and one that wouldn't generate as much heat. If you had ever used a wired unit or something similar, you would realize these things run hot, burning hot, during use, it's loud and the blades and wide - for a miniature schnauzer.<br />We looked at several cordless units that would perform the same, the first thing was the price - so much cheaper than an Andis or simiar. To be honest, when we were ready to try, we had the Andis next to us, figuring - you get what you paid for - skeptical.<br />When we started.... we were WOW-ed... these are thick coats - doggos hasn't been groomed in months, knots and all. It went through with no issues, not stucked or anything. It's size is perfect to groom around the ears and between paws - couldn't do that with an Andis. It was quiet and lightweight, and being cordless, made it so much more maneuverable. The quietness was a big plus, doggos weren't shocked or shaking as they would've.<br />MOST IMPORTANT - Temperature, grooming one kid, takes about 30 mins on average - at least, we are by no means a pro groomer, just a home groomer for our own doggos. With the Andis, either half way through or when we are done with one, the blades and unit gets super hot and we have to take breaks in between and get creative to cool it off.<br />The Oneisall - we were impressed - barely any heat even when we finished the second kid and ... battery was still at 100%.<br />Bear in mind, this is only our first time using, and we groom every few months - hopefully it will continue it's performance for at least a few more grooms.

5,Gave me my life back.,"My parents have a senior dog they are unable to care for properly, and I was in quite a moral predicament over that situation. Instead of going through legal methods,I decided to take responsibility of the dog for the sake of the dog, which required daily or every other day visits to make sure puppy pads were always swapped out. No matter what brand or size I used it was always a disaster. And this is just a little shih-tzu over the course of a day or two! The pads would always be sopping and leaking or kicked around, I just was at my wits end and emotionally and mentally miserable trying to deal with my parents and trying to ensure the dog was taken care of hygienically. And no matter what I did or said,I couldn't make things better regarding the puppy pads.<br /><br />It just felt so hopeless,because there's a solution for other similar problems, like auto-waterers,feeders,self-cleaning litterboxes,but what to do about puppy pads?<br />And then I learned about washable pads. And I got more excited,the more I read. I went with Rocket & Rex for the excellent reviews,even if I found the price steep,I rolled the dice on it.<br /><br />I am so thankful I did. The pads held up like a champ and even though they were used,they always looked clean,they always stayed put,they didn't track or leak! And as others have put it,they washed like a dream! I added in vinegar with the laundry detergent as it said not to use bleach. Washing them twice in a row got rid of the urine smell on the heavier soaked pads,and I've had similar results with just a long soak,as well. They really did come out looking brand new and ready for action.<br /><br />And I'm just so thankful. I am able to go in and check on things twice a week,allowing me some of the distance I desperately needed,while ensuring the dog always has a clean place to go.

5,Seems to work. Smell nice,"My cats, like most cats (as far as I know), don't really enjoy baths. We give them baths once a year or so, but having an alternative, like these wipes, are sure a plus. We've used some in the past, and had mixed results.<br /><br />These seem to be one of the better ones. The packaging is pretty generic, and just a green package (my favorite color). Like most wipes these days, they have the plastic top you open, and then are met with a seal that you peel off. I found that a little tricky to pull off, compared to other wipes I've used, but it came off eventually. The wipes come out, nicely, and should last awhile with how they are packaged.<br /><br />Now, of course, the real test was using on our cats. We received the green tea scent. I found it to be pleasant, and, as far as I know, the cats didn't mind it either. I used two wipes on each of our cats, and felt that it did a nice job of cleaning them up. Even though our cats are pretty good at grooming themselves, you know how it can be sometimes.. They step in something or somehow stink in one manner or another.

Every pizza box she has ever laid on has been crushed under her weight (when we first got her, she was a bit over weight and we have been working on getting that down). We adopted a second cat with lots of energy, so we needed something that can get Charcoal high and away, but be able to still support her. This thing has been suctioned to the window for a little over a month and has not budged, cracked, or ripped. We did move it once to her favorite spot for sunshine and people judging, so the suction power remains pretty good even after a move. Assembly was pretty easy - the hammock was slid onto the poles and not velcroed. Charcoal didn't like it at first... So we put the box it came in on top and she used it like that until she got used to the hammock. Charcoal is not a fan of soft fuzzy stuff so instead of using the fleece blanket, we added some of her favorite paper bags. All in all, best $20 I have ever spent.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Y2NfixKOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Y2NfixKOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Y2NfixKOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1Fr0owvyOS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1Fr0owvyOS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1Fr0owvyOS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1tTUuGb6NS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1tTUuGb6NS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1tTUuGb6NS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07MH7WTSN,B08ZD52QR5,AEQUGIS5LG6H24JU3WG3UVYJEWJQ,2021-08-02 20:06:49.887,0,True

My only complaint is I wish it didn't have fire hydrants as part of the decor on the pads. Not too cute for girl dogs, but not enough to deter me from buying them. They take a bit longer to air dry due to the size and material, but it's worth it.

The short leash and caribbeaner are perfect. The clasps are the biggest disappointment. I was banking on the security of the solid metal interlocking clasps for safety when riding, etc. However this harness has seemingly cheap plastic buckles that I don't think would be sufficient in an accident.

I imagine around 50-60 yards easy.  I only give it four stars because there is a limit on how far you can throw.  Because if you put too much energy in to it the ball will release high and not go far at all.  There is definitely a sweet spot to how hard to swing.  Also I found keeping it in a straight line with your arm vs bending it at your wrist is better.  The stick bends itself to flick it.,[],B00006IX59,B0C43QMSY9,AFJZ57GAMBS6YK6I26MHDMTSLEGQ,2015-09-30 16:53:29.000,1,True

My home is a little bit limited on space, but the cats take advantage of this like they would a cat tree. The suction cups have not had a problem sticking to the glass and they are sturdy- one of my kitties is a very large, Maine Coon mix and it stands up to him jumping up to it without fail. This is perfect for kitties that like to sit on the windowsill or tear up blinds trying to get a look outside. It's prevented my cats from mutilating my window coverings to monitor the birds.

So make sure to put the stairs at a straight angle so the bed is kind of like the last step.  We had to start him off slowly by me holding him and just letting his feet touch the steps all the way to the top and then making a big deal about how good he was and clapping.  After the third time of doing it, he is up and down all by himself.  So we received it in the afternoon and before bedtime he was doing it himself with some apprehension.

5,THE ANSWER for Canine Arthritis,"Absolutely effective. Sucks that we have to store the big bag in the fridge, but worth it for the results. Our dog was getting bad arthritis, and limping after any kind of distance running (his favorite activity). After putting this in his food regularly for a couple weeks, the difference was night and day. No limping, no pain, and he could run with us every day like he did when he was younger. Couldn't be happier with this stuff.

4,Great Quality,"I bought this ahead of time for the upcoming winter season so that I would have it when I need it for my senior dog.  Because I haven't tested it out in inclement weather yet, I only gave it 4 stars.  If it works out like I think it will, it will deserve 5 stars.  I ordered the 17 inch Windstorm Series in charcoal and gray.  He has a 20 inch back length and 24 inch girth.  The girth is a bit loose on him, but that's how it goes with longer bodied dogs.  However, the quality is excellent and the fill is substantial.  I am sure that it will cover him well and keep him toasty whether for a quick potty break or a short little rambling hike out in the wilds.  Beneath the coat is room for a harness.  Beneath the harness hole is fleece material between the opening and the dog.  The elastic leg straps in the rear have clips so that you don't have to pick up the dog's legs to thread them through the straps.  I like the excellent neck coverage of the detachable neck cover, the nylon lining, and the overall appearance.  I also like that it uses buckles instead of velcro.  For some reason, the charcoal/black was deeply discounted at less than $20, so I think I got a great deal.  I wish there was a size between the 17 inch and the 22 inch coats.  I really wish that Derby Originals made coats that are longer in the back and smaller in the girth for those long bodied dogs.  Their coats really are very nice quality.",[],B07B8F2SRR,B085QBVS9M,AHYI3CTKGL2PBAMDDE5QPLCZ3FRA,2019-10-01 02:58:09.281,0,True

I was concerned about fit, durability, comfort, floatation, keeping her head up, and being able to lift her and guess what covers all of those bases: THIS! I took her measurements just as the picture said and purchased the Large, I believe. She was a few pounds under the recommended weight at the time but I knew she was going to gain a little more weight and bought it anyways. The fit is adjustable and leaves my pup feeling secure, the product has held up for multiple swims and continues to hold, my pup has never had an issue walking, running, swimming, or playing while wearing this lifevest, it keeps my top-heavy bully afloat, the chin part keeps her face up so she can breathe, and the double-handles makes lifting her out of the water easy and safe!

5,Chew-Zilla was denied destruction,"I have a year and a half old chocolate Labrador retriever, Loki, that chews and chews hard. I bought this toy because a neighbor who has a yellow lab has had the same toy for over a year.  I can buy a toy and Loki will have it broken or severely damaged within minutes.  It's easy to kiss 10 dollar toys good bye in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br /> I have had the product for about a month and it is by far Loki's favorite toy, even without treats.  I have played tug of war, fetch, and other dog favorite games; the ball-like object is in perfect condition still.  He will carry the toy about the house in his mouth, very regal and proud looking, as if he's King In The Castle.<br /><br />Some dog toys over time will gain a very bad odor.  After a month of constant use, this thing does not give off an odor that I can tell.  I won't put my nose or mouth near it, but from a couple of feet away, it still seems to smell like new.  If this ever gains an odor of some sort, I will probably resort to washing it and then adding some vanilla extract to the water to give it a humanly pleasant flavor.  I have done this for other toys and Loki seems to have a renewed interest in them.<br /><br />I have not allowed him to take the toy outside as we have several feet of snow and that would just be begging to be lost.  Based on the design, this thing will be a dirt magnet on the inside, especially since my backyard is in quasi-woods with zero grass.<br /><br />The treats that came with it seemed to be enjoyable for Loki.  It took him about an hour and a half to eat.  He didn't figure out how to pop them out as some people have stated.  He just gnawed and licked it the whole time.  The treats are a bit expensive, as I can buy raw hides or real bones for less.<br /><br />Peanut butter is your friend.  Smear some on the inside and Loki goes crazy trying to lick and clear it.

4,"Not bad, but probably better for smaller dogs.","[[VIDEOID:b45080648d865e99475405c002ecabb5]] This might be better for smaller dogs. My guy eats 1 cup of food per meal and I have to fill up all the little bubbles (barns, the instructions call them) and then I fill up the four holes where the food comes out too. I'd say it's probably best for dogs who eat 1/2 a cup at a time. His food (Purina One) fits in the holes, but I also think something with smaller pieces would work better. Additionally, he's big enough to try to rip pieces off of this thing... He tried to chew on one of the doors once but didn't really try to destroy anything (though, once it was empty, I put it away immediately)<br />That said, this did keep him occupied for about 6 or 7 minutes, batting things around and opening the little doors. He can eat a bowl of food in about 30 seconds, so this is much better than that. It did move around WAY too much and he had trouble moving the bubbles because the whole thing scooted unless he held it down with a paw. The listing mentions rubber pads, but it's more of an adhesive, and I'm not too fond of the idea of adhering it to the floor... I wish it had a grippy rubberized or silicone finish on the bottom instead.<br />It's pretty easy to clean. The little bubbles can come off so you can clean them individually and get to the surface to clean the top well. Also, it comes with an extra door (probably in case a dog chews one off...)<br />Overall, I think this is a good product, but it could use a few improvements and is better for smaller dogs. I have a Kong Wobbler that my dog usually uses for meals, and that's probably what I'll continue to use most of the time. But, this can be fun to pull out when he needs a little challenge or to get some brain energy expended.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qAC2zBXiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qAC2zBXiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qAC2zBXiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BFB7NZKR,B0BFB7NZKR,AGFI6ESPJZMQI5ZN6YIIUHUO7VEQ,2022-11-27 17:31:57.427,2,False

5,Great for introducing cats!,"This is a very good product! I recently took in a new cat and I’m trying to slowly introduce him to my other 2 kitties. I’m following the method recommended by Jackson Galaxy (videos are on YouTube), and now we’re to the point to where it’s time for my kitties to see each other from a safe distance. This screen is perfect for that.<br /><br />I did read many reviews from other models by different sellers, and a common complaint for those was the lack of strength for the Velcro. With this model, I think the Velcro is quite strong. It bonded well to my door frame, which I did wipe down with isopropyl alcohol beforehand. Even though I do think the Velcro is quite strong, I still did reinforce mine with some nails just to be safe. For most cats, I don’t think it’s necessary to do this step. My new cat did climb to the top, so keep that in mind if your kitty is heavy. The screen is dense but definitely see-through. My new kitty can’t get through the screen to claw my other kitties.<br /><br />The zipper is very good too. There are double zippers on both sides, and they work very well. You will definitely want to measure your door and make sure your purchasing the appropriate size. Mine fit my door perfectly, meaning there wasn’t wiggle room.

1,"Wanted to love it, but.....","I was real excited when I bought this product. I really liked it at first, but after about 4 months of use I can see I should've went for better quality.<br /><br />Complaints:<br />  #1 It leaks. It seems to leak around the o-rings that move with the pistons to allow and stop the flow of water through the filter. They are loose or stretch and get pinched in the opening they are supposed to slide into. Thus allowing the slow leak that you see around the base of the filter. FYI: if you kind of try to ""work it in"" that usually works and no more leaks.<br />  #2 The stupid yellow handle is made of thin plastic and when you turn it to open and close the valves its kind of a soft connection to the valves. It would be better if it was aluminum or whatever material is stiffer and allows full closure of the valves.<br />  #3 Cheap clamps for the connections. Had to use automotive clams cause mine kept leaking.<br />  #4 It leaks again! It leaked from the base of the unit. Not from the filter. This tricked me cause I thought it was my filter leaking again so I took the filter off and resolved to do fix it in the morning since it was late. When I woke up I had to figure out why my 55 gallon tank was missing 3in of water from the top.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />  It does what it's supposed to do. When it works it works, is whisper quiet, and my water is crystal clear, but it's not worth the headache though.

One of them managed to perch on the top. It's sturdy, steady, and durable.

I use it mainly for my oldies to take their meds with.  Scoop out a spoonful and hide their pills inside the meat and down the hatch they go without even a thought. I also put a small dollop on top of their kibble.  One container will last me about 2 days (4-5 meals for 2 dogs getting a couple spoonfuls per meal), and I just set it in the fridge once opened to keep it fresh.  I'm not impressed however with the cardboard packaging.  You have to get out the scissors, unfold the top, cut the top off at the dotted line, then open, and refold to seal.  It's also impossible to get all the meat out of the bottom corners of the container, unless you add some water and swish around and pour it out, and still may have some left stuck in the corners.

5,A MUST for Labs!,"These balls and the Chuckit have been a lifesaver for us. Currently, we have two Labs (3 1/2 years old and a 8 month old). These guys need exercise and they both love to play ball. Actually, they're relentless about it. They either want to eat or play ball. I'm afraid they would run till they pass out, so we have to stop playing after so many throws, because they just will not quit. A few minutes of throwing the ball as far as possible & they're satisfied for a while. The balls are tough too. They love to tear the felt off of tennis balls, so that's no good. These Chuckit balls fit the bill. Plus the glow in the dark ball is awesome. If we go somewhere during the day, getting home after dark, we use the Glow in the Dark ball (which charges up quickly with a MagLight flashlight) & can get some energy spent at night. Best is the bright orange one. I wish it was offered in a two-pack, because it's so much easier to see when the dog misses the throw & you're out walking in tall grass searching for a little ball. They're tough also. Our little one is a chewer, but hasn't chewed up one of these balls yet. We only have bought a dozen of these, because we lose them. Either they get left in the yard & found by the lawnmower, bounce into the pond, or the dog carries it off somewhere. But I make sure to always have a backup. That's how important these are to our doggie/human relationship.

4,Comfortable and fits well. Will shred in time.,"This Extra Small Soft Kong recovery / &#34;E&#34; / Elizabethan collar fits my 10 lb cat just fine. It was easy to slip it over her head, draw the string snug (with room to slip a finger or two between the collar and her neck), and then tie a small knot to prevent the clasp from slipping.<br /><br />It's been on her almost continuously for over a week.  She has not been able to remove it, try as she might.  She cannot lick her tail, not scratch her ears/face with this on.<br /><br />The soft collar does help out when she bumps around the house, as it is not quite as jarring an experience as it would be with a stiff collar.  I've kept her nails trimmed short, but still she is slowly scratching away at the fabric.<br /><br />The cone has two layers of fabric, with 'boning' within to help keep it stiff.  After receiving it, you will need to reshape the boning to make a good cone shape.  I think the boning is very thin strips of metal.<br /><br />She adapted well to it, and this is the first time she was in a collar.  She can eat and drink, and seems to sleep just fine.  She even jumps around, after learning that she has no peripheral vision.  But I do take fragile objects down now.  A note on food and water:  Use a bowl that the edges curve  in, or gets narrower, towards the base.  Typical wide based pet bowls proved to be hard for her to eat and drink from, as the collar gets in the way.  With a narrow based bowl, the collar fits under the lip of the bowl.<br /><br />After about 1 week, I noticed tears in the outside fabric from her nails.  It was only too soon that she would catch on one of those small tears and break through.  So, I merely reversed the collar, so the outside was inside and a new fresh layer awaited her attempts.<br /><br />I'm sure that by the end of the second week, she will have broken through.  I've ordered a second collar to be ready when that happens.<br /><br />I can't knock the product for wearing out though, as IT IS FABRIC and it WILL TEAR.  I think for the price and the amount of time it lasts, it is a fair deal.<br /><br />I did knock 1 star off though for the way it arrived.  The cone was very misshaped and needed to be carefully reshaped. The boning is very thin, and if you are too aggressive at reshaping, it could snap.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a very good product.",[],B004GEAQ3W,B0058B5XD0,AHT3JBUXZ77T6TJS7ECXJ4NUWWAA,2012-12-12 16:39:40.000,3,True

5,Very attractive set and a great value!,"I’m really happy with this collar set! See accompanying pictures for a visual reference.<br /><br />The colors as I hoped match very with my pup, but the beige and subtle red and black is a great combination.  The quality of the snaps and leash latch seem very solid; I especially appreciate that the leash latch opens very wide making it easier to get in the collar (in fact, you could fit it on the collar itself instead of trying to locate the d-ring ..  very handy).  The bow tie is a great touch, though as with my pup may be hard to see with long-haired dogs.  The tie has small elastic bands for easy removal/putting on.  The last nice touch is a small bell which is actually pretty loud! I took it off, though, because was freaking out my pup.  I think the leather backing is maybe not as durable—I probably would rather have had just the material throughout.  But it is a nice color and texture contrast.<br /><br />The leash is longer than I expected and a good, useful length in my book.  It’s similarly attractive and well made as the collar.<br /><br />So, I absolutely do recommend giving this set a look!

4,Pros and Cons,"The size of this cage is more than I anticipated, it's amazingly large! It has a lot of nice features as well, although not all of them work out too well. Our youngest guinea pig learned to use the ramp within the first 24 hrs and LOVES running (yes, running) up and down it. However, our older guinea pig (who's about a year old) has still not learned how to use the ramp and it has been about a month now. The green hide-away/food access platform keeps getting peed on, which is pretty awful. We ended up removing it and putting a hammock there instead. Also, the hole which the ramp is attached to causes much of the litter to fall into the lower cage, and within a week, the upper cage is almost without litter, We are making our own modification to resolve this. We bought pvc baseboard pieces and are going to make edging around the hole to help hold the litter back so it doesn't fall through. Overall, it needs these modifications! But for the size of the cage, and the price, I still don't regret it.",[],B00MOSSF2G,B00MOSSF2G,AHRR6UVKWNBOXRW6Y43XU55VQEKA,2019-01-01 18:15:26.161,3,True

5,"I Love It, The Cat Wants to Suplex It","Short Version:<br />It works, and most importantly it survives constant abuse.<br />Some mods/improvements could be had though imho.<br /><br />Long Version:<br />I have a calico that was terribly overfed by my prior roommates that I have the pleasure of dieting now that we're living solo. Portioning & Scheduling worked, but I was tired of being woken up 15min before my first alarm every day, as well as surviving the regularly scheduled ""Diet Riots"" from my not-so-tiny monster.<br /><br />Enter the Ymiko Automatic Feeder.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I am no longer the food dispenser, so I can sleep peacefully... to a point.<br />- Unlike people, the feeder cannot be bullied into extra pity servings. It is cold, heartless, and gives a calculated feeding at a precise time. This also means I can enjoy life outside without worrying about Ms Kitty's schedule.<br />- My god is it RESILIENT. I have seen this thing get thrown to the side, slammed against the wall for hours on end, and outright abused for the last 2 months by a very hangry calico cat. But it does not open up, and even on it's side it will only spit out the calculated portion at the calculated time.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Unfortunately, kitty has learned she can reach her arm up the chute and rattle around for a chance at an extra1-2 pieces of kibble. She gets maybe 1 extra kibble per day, but all its done it reinforce her that there's a CHANCE. If she is anything, she is persistent. A little one-way door would solve this, so some kitchen-engineering is in the works to create a fix.<br /><br />- The bowl is easily detached from the feeder during it's frequent boxing matches. I know this is for easy cleaning but I almost wish it was permanently attached, or made from a heavier material. I also wish said bowl had some kind of felt/rubber feet, because the sound of plastic scraping over vinyl flooring is just awful. A hand towel under the feeder is the easiest fix I've found.<br /><br />- It is a lightweight machine that is (somehow) surviving each day with a 16lb calico that wants nothing more than to see this thing destroyed. I wish it had a heavier base to help keep it from being rocked about so easily. While I am not being pestered at 5:45am, I can still hear the poor feeder being slammed against the wall at 6:03am every day when kitty attempts to bully more food from it. If a 5lb weight can't fix this, my next step is to secure it to a table leg so it cannot be moved by man or beast.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gVIZQP96L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gVIZQP96L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41gVIZQP96L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0982Q4724,B0C7GN11F2,AGQXY2TUV46RQVS7GTIMR4KHAO7A,2022-12-22 14:55:52.217,163,True

I line it with fleece and just take that out, throw it in the washer, and wash all his toys and food things to clean it. I'd definitely buy this again, and am planning to buy another and use the extension feature when I have more space to give him more room to play, although 8 sqft is plenty for a hedgehog, and he gets plenty of time outside his cage anyway.

I started looking for a glucosamine supplement when my westie turned 9 and had difficulty walking up the slopes during our walks and needed more tries to jump up the couch. A close friend of mine with 3 dogs recommended this so I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />I thought the Beef liver flavor would make this supplement more palatable for my westie but I guess it wasn't enough as it smelled more medicinal than anything as he wouldn't eat it. I decided I would turn this into a powder form using my food processor and sprinkle over his kibbles. To mask the medicinal smell, I would mix a tiny amount of the supplement powder with a tsp of coconut oil, followed by his kibbles and serve. It worked! He ate it up right away since he loves coconut oil. I gradually increase the supplement over time so that he would get used to the taste of this new supplement and he has been doing much better ever since. He would even run up the slope now at 10.5 years old.<br /><br />I saw some reviewers mentioned that their dog wouldn't eat this supplement and thought I could share what I did to get my dog to eat it and experience the health benefits this supplement provide.<br /><br />FYI, I kept the powder form of the supplement in a dark and cool place and it didn't clump or go bad.",[],B00V45IQF6,B07GZXN3BR,AEGQTFBDWFUC7I732ZS2HBOYXAAA,2017-10-24 19:04:10.255,0,True
